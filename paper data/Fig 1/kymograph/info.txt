The data are given by following vectors:
- tAll: experimental time (h)
- Rout: biofilm radius (um)
- Aout: outer radius of the radial pattern (um)
- Sout: outer radius of the zigzag pattern (um)
- Ain: inner radius of the radial pattern / inoculation core radius (um)

Only non-zero components have physical meanings.
